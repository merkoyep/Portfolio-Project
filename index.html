                <p>
                    Growing up, I had always known that I wanted to pursue a career that made a positive impact. 
                    Initially, I thought that becoming a teacher would suit me best because I loved mentoring and 
                    coaching others. To pursue this, I went to UBC to pursue a degree in History, and got experience 
                    working with children as a program instructor at my local community centre.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was at City Centre Community Centre that I discovered how impactful community recreation is, and 
                    I ended up working full time as a program coordinator for two years, while finishing off my bachelor's 
                    degree.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon graduation, I was offered a full time position as a Recreation Leader for the City of Richmond. In 
                    the next years, I was promoted to a Community Facilities Coordinator position, where I was responsible for 
                    a wider range of services and operations at the community centre. One of the key responsibilities I had was 
                    integrating a new registration software into our facility's existing operations. From creating user guides 
                    to designing workarounds, I eventually discovered an interest in software design.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 2022, I applied to Shopify's Dev Degree program, and Dominican University of California's Applied Computer 
                    Science program. In 2023, I was accepted and am now currently working to develop my skills as a software engineer.
