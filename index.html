                <p>
                I was born and raised in Richmond, BC where I aspired to pursue a 
                career where I could make an impact in my community. Through high 
                school, I wanted to become a secondary school history teacher, 
                because of my passion with mentoring others, and my interest in 
                historical studies.
                <br> 
                <br>
                To gain experience working with young people, I volunteered at City 
                Centre Community Centre as a program assistant, and was hired as a 
                program instructor when I was 15. I continued working part-time 
                throughout high school and university, until 2018, where I was 
                offered a full time position as a youth programmer at City Centre. 
                I accepted the position and was able to complete my degree as a 
                part-time student. Through this experience, I discovered my 
                obsession with making an impact in the community as a youth 
                worker.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2021, I graduated from UBC with a Bachelor of Arts in History 
                with distinction. Concurrently, I was offered a position to work for 
                the City of Richmond as a recreation programmer for City Centre 
                Community Centre. I decided to continue my career in recreation, and 
                attained a position as a Community Facilities Coordinator in 2022. 
                <br>
                <br>
                While my role focused on the supervision and leadership of community 
                recreation programs, I found that I was incredibly interested in 
                creating digital solutions to business processes, and troubleshooting 
                issues that we had with software in our business operations. At this 
                point in my recreation career, I had the choice to pursue a more 
                managerial position, continue as a programmer, or capitalize on my 
                newfound interest to pursue a career as a software engineer and 
                continue driving impact through technology.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer 
                Science at the Dominican University of California. Additionally, 
                I am a Dev Degree Intern at Shopify, where I am developing skills 
                as a software engineer through hands-on experience, self-learning, 
                and theoretical foundations.
